    <h1>Storytelling & Coaching Summaries</h1>

    <div class="summary">
        <h2>Summary of Key Learnings</h2>
        <p>Storytelling helps create **connection and engagement** by bringing people into the moment rather than just recounting events. The best stories resonate with shared human experiences and feelings.</p>
        <p>**Metaphors** play a key role in effective storytelling, as they allow people to step into a new perspective and experience rather than just analyzing a situation.</p>
        <p>By **using "you" instead of "I"**, storytelling becomes more immersive, making the listener feel part of the story.</p>
        <p>Great stories also **light up the whole brain**, leading to better engagement, learning, and connection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="summary">
